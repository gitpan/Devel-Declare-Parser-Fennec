NAME
    Devel::Declare::Parser::Fennec - The parser for Fennec syntax.

FENNEC PROJECT
    This module is part of the Fennec project. See Fennec for more details.
    Fennec is a project to develop an extendable and powerful testing
    framework. Together the tools that make up the Fennec framework provide
    a potent testing environment.

    The tools provided by Fennec are also useful on their own. Sometimes a
    tool created for Fennec is useful outside the greator framework. Such
    tools are turned into their own projects. This is one such project.

    Fennec - The core framework
      The primary Fennec project that ties them all together.

SYNTAX PROVIDED
    This parser provides fennec like syntax. This means a keyword, optional
    name, coderef and options.

    Examples:

        # These automatically give you $self
        keyword name { ... }
        keyword 'string name' { ... }
        keyword name ( KEY => 'VALUE' ) { ... }

        # These do not automatically give you $self
        # These are not effected by the parser.
        keyword name => sub { ... };
        keyword name => (
            method => sub { ... },
            ...
        );
